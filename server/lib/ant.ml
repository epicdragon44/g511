(* TODO: Fill out this file, using dan.ml as an example template.
    - Extract out functionality from bin/main.ml into this file. For each function:
        - Implement as many helper functions where possible.
        - Document each one with a description of
            - what it does
            - what it takes as input
            - what it returns
            - an example of how to use it
            - pre-conditions and post-conditions
          - Example in bot/lib/lib.ml
        - CHECK for pre conditions in the body of the function, and raise an exception if they are not met!
        - Write readable, verbose code where possible.
    - Add unit tests using the Jane Street testing framework. See dan.ml's unit tests for examples.
