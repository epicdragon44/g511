(* TODO: Fill out this file, using dan.ml as an example template.
    - Extract out functionality from bin/main.ml into this file. For each function:
        - Implement as many helper functions where possible.
        - Document every function you write carefully with a full description, including pre and post conditions, as well as what the inputs are and what the output will be.
        - CHECK for pre conditions in the body of the function, and raise an exception if they are not met!
        - Write readable, verbose code where possible.
    - Add unit tests to server/tests/main.ml for each function you write.
        - You can import your module using `open Server.<YourModule>` at the top. If there's an error, run `make build` in root as usual.
        - From there, just use OUnit as usual. You can mimic the code I already have in there.
