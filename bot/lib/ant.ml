(* TODO: Implement helper functions here that:
   - checks pre-conditions and throws error on violation
   - take in user text,
   - processes it,
   - calls the server at http://localhost:9000/ with your request,
   - and then takes the result, re-processes it into a user-readable string, and then returns that string.

   Split this into multiple functions as you see fit.

   Document each one with a description of
   - what it does
   - what it takes as input
   - what it returns
   - pre-conditions and post-conditions
   - an example of how to use it
   Example in lib.ml

   Then, TEST each one. This should be similar to how you did server/lib/<ur name>.ml
