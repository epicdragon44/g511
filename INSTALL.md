# Pre-requisites

You must have Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or later, or Mac OSX 10.14 or later. Windows is NOT supported.

If you are on Mac, you must also have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.

Then, you must have OCaml and OPAM installed as described in the Cornell CS 3110 Textbook [installation instructions](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/preface/install.html#).

# Installation

Make sure you are in the root directory of the repository, then run `make initialize` to setup everything for the first time.

Having done this, return to **`README.md` > Documentation** and keep reading for instructions on building, testing, and running.

# Notice

You might be thinking "surely there's more to it than a simple `make initialize`?!"

I'm afraid you would be mistaken.
