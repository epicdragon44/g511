# Welcome to the Documentation File

We'll endeavor to explain documentation decisions in this file. This is primarily for CS 3110 project graders.

First, you must be aware of the structure of our project. If you are still unfamiliar with it, please return to the [README](README.md) and read the section on **Project Structure**.

---

Having been made aware of the project structure, you will see that it logically follows that, since we are to "exclude any test or executable modules" as is stated in the MS3 Handout, we will be documenting only the `lib` files -- a.k.a. the actually relevant functionality -- within each of the two subprojects (`bot` and `server`).

Note ALSO that since there are two subprojects, each with their own generated documentation, we will be documenting each subproject separately. That is, we will be documenting `bot` and `server` separately. This is a direct consequence of our code organization. To make it easier for you, the Project Grader, we have provided links to the documentation for each subproject in a "root" `index.html` file, which you can find at `docs/index.html` after having generated the documentation in the first place.

Wondering how to generate the docs yourself? Return to the [DOCS.md](DOCS.md) file and read the section **Read the Docs**.
