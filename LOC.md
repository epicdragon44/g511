# Welcome to the Lines of Code File

We'll endeavor to explain decisions regarding how we counted lines of code in this file. This is primarily for CS 3110 project graders.

Our `make loc` command counts all lines of code in `.ml` and `.mli` files, and those files only. Obviously, it excludes `_build` folders and the like.
